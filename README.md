# We need help developing this plugin ðŸ’¡

In the meantime you can use our official guide: https://docs.flayyer.com/guides/javascript/gatsbyjs

We want this plugin to:

- Bundle and upload templates located in the `/templates` directory.
- Generate URLs per page using [flayyer/flayyer-js](https://https://github.com/flayyer/flayyer-js).
- Download the image locally to the public directory.
- Update the `<head>` tags to point to the local files but prefixed with the absolute deployment URL.
